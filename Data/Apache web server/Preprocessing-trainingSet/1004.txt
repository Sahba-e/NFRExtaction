/*
* Call <func> for each context. This can stop when an error occurs, or
* simply iterate through the whole list.
*
* Returns 1 if an error occurs (and the iteration is aborted). Returns 0
* if all elements are processed.
*
* If <reverse> is true (non-zero), then the list is traversed in
* reverse order.
