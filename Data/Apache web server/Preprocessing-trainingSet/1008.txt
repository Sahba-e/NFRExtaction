/*
* Check If-Headers and existing locks.
*
* Note: depth == 0 normally requires no multistatus response. However,
* if we pass DAV_VALIDATE_PARENT, then we could get an error on a URI
* other than the Request-URI, thereby requiring a multistatus.
*
* If the resource is a locknull resource, then the UNLOCK will affect
* the parent collection (much like a delete). For that case, we must
* validate the parent resource's conditions.
