/*
** There is some rough support for writable DAV:getcontenttype and
** DAV:getcontentlanguage properties. If this #define is (1), then
** this support is disabled.
**
** We are disabling it because of a lack of support in GET and PUT
** operations. For GET, it would be "e;expensive"e; to look for a propdb,
** open it, and attempt to extract the Content-Type and Content-Language
** values for the response.
** (Handling the PUT would not be difficult, though)
