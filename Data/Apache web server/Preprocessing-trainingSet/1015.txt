** Hrm. IE5 will pass unqualified hostnames for both the
** Host: and Destination: headers. This breaks the
** http_vhost.c::matches_aliases function.
**
** For now, qualify unqualified comp.hostnames with
** r->server->server_hostname.
**
** ### this is a big hack. Apache should provide a better way.
** ### maybe the admin should list the unqualified hosts in a
** ### <ServerAlias> block?
