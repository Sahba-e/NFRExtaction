/* Q: is there any advantage to passing a brigade for each bucket?
* A: obviously, it can cut down server resource consumption, if this
* experimental module was fed a file of 4MB, it would be using 8MB for
* the 'read' buckets and the 'write' buckets.
*
* Note it is more efficient to consume (destroy) each bucket as it's
* processed above than to do a single cleanup down here. In any case,
* don't let our caller pass the same buckets to us, twice;
