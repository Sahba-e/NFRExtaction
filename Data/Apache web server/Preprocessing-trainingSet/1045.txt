/*
* This function gets called to merge two per-directory configuration
* records. This is typically done to cope with things like .htaccess files
* or <Location> directives for directories that are beneath one for which a
* configuration record was already created. The routine has the
* responsibility of creating a new record and merging the contents of the
* other two into it appropriately. If the module doesn't declare a merge
* routine, the record for the closest ancestor location (that has one) is
* used exclusively.
*
* The routine MUST NOT modify any of its arguments!
*
* The return value is a pointer to the created module-specific structure
* containing the merged values.
