/* if an error was received, bail out now. If the error is
* EAGAIN and we have not yet seen an EOS, we will definitely
* be called again, at which point we will send our buffered
* data. Instead of sending EAGAIN, some filters return an
* empty brigade instead when data is not yet available. In
* this case, pass through the APR_SUCCESS and emulate the
* underlying filter.
