/* Here is the logic :
* Read the readbytes data from next level fiter into bbinp. Loop through
* the buckets in bbinp and read the data from buckets and invoke
* sed_eval_buffer on the data. libsed will generate its output using
* sed_write_output which will add data in ctx->bb. Do it until it have
* atleast one bucket in ctx->bb. At the end of data eos bucket
* should be there.
*
* Once eos bucket is seen, then invoke sed_finalize_eval to clear the
* output. If the last byte of data is not a new line character then sed
* will add a new line to the data that is default sed behaviour. Note
* that using this filter with POST data, caller may not expect this
* behaviour.
*
* If next level fiter generate the flush bucket, we can't do much about
* it. If we want to return the flush bucket in brigade bb (to the caller)
* the question is where to add it?
