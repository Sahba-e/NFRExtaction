* If the number of buckets in ctx->passbb reaches an
* "e;insane"e; level, we consume much memory for all the
* buckets as such. So lets flush them down the chain
* in this case and thus clear ctx->passbb. This frees
* the buckets memory for further processing.
* Usually this condition should not become true, but
* it is a safety measure for edge cases.
