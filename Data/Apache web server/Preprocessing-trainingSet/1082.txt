/* DEFAULT_CONNECT_ATTEMPTS controls how many times we'll try to connect
* to the cgi daemon from the thread/process handling the cgi request.
* Generally we want to retry when we get ECONNREFUSED since it is
* probably because the listen queue is full. We need to try harder so
* the client doesn't see it as a 503 error.
*
* Set this to 0 to continually retry until the connect works or Apache
* terminates.
