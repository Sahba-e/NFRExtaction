/* On AIX, for processes like mod_cgid's script children where
* SIGCHLD is ignored, kill(pid,0) returns success for up to
* one second after the script child exits, based on when a
* daemon runs to clean up unnecessary process table entries.
* getpgid() can report the proper info (-1/ESRCH) immediately.
