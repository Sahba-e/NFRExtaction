/* RFC 2616, Section 3.6.1
*
* If there is an EOS bucket, then prefix it with:
* 1) the last-chunk marker ("e;0"e; CRLF)
* 2) the trailer
* 3) the end-of-chunked body CRLF
*
* We only do this if we have not seen an error bucket with
* status HTTP_BAD_GATEWAY. We have memorized an
* error bucket that we had seen in the filter context.
* The error bucket with status HTTP_BAD_GATEWAY indicates that the
* connection to the backend (mod_proxy) broke in the middle of the
* response. In order to signal the client that something went wrong
* we do not create the last-chunk marker and set c->keepalive to
* AP_CONN_CLOSE in the core output filter.
*
* XXX: it would be nice to combine this with the end-of-chunk
* marker above, but this is a bit more straight-forward for
* now.
