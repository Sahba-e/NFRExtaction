/* If we have a variant list validator (vlv) due to the
* response being negotiated, then we create a structured
* entity tag which merges the variant etag with the variant
* list validator (vlv). This merging makes revalidation
* somewhat safer, ensures that caches which can deal with
* Vary will (eventually) be updated if the set of variants is
* changed, and is also a protocol requirement for transparent
* content negotiation.
