/*
* Compares two DNs to see if they're equal. The only way to do this correctly
* is to search for the dn and then do ldap_get_dn() on the result. This should
* match the initial dn, since it would have been also retrieved with
* ldap_get_dn(). This is expensive, so if the configuration value
* compare_dn_on_server is false, just does an ordinary strcmp.
*
* The lock for the ldap cache should already be acquired.
