* This is uncool.

* When you create a <Section handler in httpd, the only 'easy' way to create
* a directory context is to parse the section, and convert it into a 'normal'
* Configureation option, and then collapse the entire section, in memory,
* back into the parent section -- from which you can then get the new directive
* invoked.... anyways. evil. Rici taught me how to do this hack :-)
