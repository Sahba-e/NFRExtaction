/*
* Record of available info on a particular variant
*
* Note that a few of these fields are updated by the actual negotiation
* code. These are:
*
* level_matched --- initialized to zero. Set to the value of level
* if the client actually accepts this media type at that
* level (and *not* if it got in on a wildcard). See level_cmp
* below.
* mime_stars -- initialized to zero. Set to the number of stars
* present in the best matching Accept header element.
* 1 for star/star, 2 for type/star and 3 for
* type/subtype.
*
* definite -- initialized to 1. Set to 0 if there is a match which
* makes the variant non-definite according to the rules
* in rfc2296.
