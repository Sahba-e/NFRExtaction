/* Each unregonized bit better match our base name, in sequence.
* A test of index.html.foo will match index.foo or index.html.foo,
* but it will never transpose the segments and allow index.foo.html
* because that would introduce too much CPU consumption. Better that
* we don't attempt a many-to-many match here.
