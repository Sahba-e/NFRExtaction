/* Sort the variants into a canonical order. The negotiation
* result sometimes depends on the order of the variants. By
* sorting the variants into a canonical order, rather than using
* the order in which readdir() happens to return them, we ensure
* that the negotiation result will be consistent over filesystem
* backup/restores and over all mirror sites.
