/*
* set_encoding_quality determines whether the encoding for a particular
* variant is acceptable for the user-agent.
*
* The rules for encoding are that if the user-agent does not supply
* any Accept-Encoding header, then all encodings are allowed but a
* variant with no encoding should be preferred.
* If there is an empty Accept-Encoding header, then no encodings are
* acceptable. If there is a non-empty Accept-Encoding header, then
* any of the listed encodings are acceptable, as well as no encoding
* unless the "e;identity"e; encoding is specifically excluded.
