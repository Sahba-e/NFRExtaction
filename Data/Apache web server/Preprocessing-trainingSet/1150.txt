/* RFC 2296 calls for the result to be rounded to 5 decimal places,
* but we don't do that because it serves no useful purpose other
* than to ensure that a remote algorithm operates on the same
* precision as ours. That is silly, since what we obviously want
* is for the algorithm to operate on the best available precision
* regardless of who runs it. Since the above calculation may
* result in significant variance at 1e-12, rounding would be bogus.
