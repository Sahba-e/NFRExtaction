/* return number of chars of the scheme (incl. '://')
* if the URI is absolute (includes a scheme etc.)
* otherwise 0.
* If supportqs is not NULL, we return a whether or not
* the scheme supports a query string or not.
*
* NOTE: If you add new schemes here, please have a
* look at escape_absolute_uri and splitout_queryargs.
* Not every scheme takes query strings and some schemes
* may be handled in a special way.
*
* XXX: we may consider a scheme registry, perhaps with
* appropriate escape callbacks to allow other modules
* to extend mod_rewrite at runtime.
