/* when `RewriteEngine off' was used in the per-server
* context then the rewritemap-programs were not spawned.
* In this case using such a map (usually in per-dir context)
* is useless because it is not available.
*
* newlines in the key leave bytes in the pipe and cause
* bad things to happen (next map lookup will use the chars
* after the \n instead of the new key etc etc - in other words,
* the Rewritemap falls out of sync with the requests).
