/* For rules evaluated in server context, the mod_proxy fixup
* hook can be relied upon to escape the URI as and when
* necessary, since it occurs later. If in directory context,
* the ordering of the fixup hooks is forced such that
* mod_proxy comes first, so the URI must be escaped here
* instead. See PR 39746, 46428, and other headaches. */
