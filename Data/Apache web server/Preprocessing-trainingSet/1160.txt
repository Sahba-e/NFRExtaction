/* Special Rewriting Feature: Self-Reduction
* We reduce the URL by stripping a possible
* http[s]://<ourhost>[:<port>] prefix, i.e. a prefix which
* corresponds to ourself. This is to simplify rewrite maps
* and to avoid recursion, etc. When this prefix is not a
* coincidence then the user has to use [R] explicitly (see
* above).
