/*
* The spdist() should have found the majority of the misspelled
* requests. It is of questionable use to continue looking for
* files with the same base name, but potentially of totally wrong
* type (index.html <-> index.db).
*
* If you're using MultiViews, and have a file named foobar.html,
* which you refer to as "e;foobar"e;, and someone tried to access
* "e;Foobar"e;, without CheckBasenameMatch, mod_speling won't find it,
* because it won't find anything matching that spelling.
* With the extension-munging, it would locate "e;foobar.html"e;.
