/*
* Go through the whole list, stopping if you find a match. Process all the
* continuations of that match before returning.
*
* We support multi-level continuations:
*
* At any time when processing a successful top-level match, there is a current
* continuation level; it represents the level of the last successfully
* matched continuation.
*
* Continuations above that level are skipped as, if we see one, it means that
* the continuation that controls them - i.e, the lower-level continuation
* preceding them - failed to match.
*
* Continuations below that level are processed as, if we see one, it means
* we've finished processing or skipping higher-level continuations under the
* control of a successful or unsuccessful lower-level continuation, and are
* now seeing the next lower-level continuation and should process it. The
* current continuation level reverts to the level of the one we're seeing.
*
* Continuations at the current level are processed as, if we see one, there's
* no lower-level continuation that may have failed.
*
* If a continuation matches, we bump the current continuation level so that
* higher-level continuations are processed.
