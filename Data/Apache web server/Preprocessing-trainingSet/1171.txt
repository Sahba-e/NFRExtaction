/*
* The idea behind the find_best_bytraffic scheduler is the following:
*
* We know the amount of traffic (bytes in and out) handled by each
* worker. We normalize that traffic by each workers' weight. So assuming
* a setup as below:
*
* worker a b c
* lbfactor 1 1 3
*
* the scheduler will allow worker c to handle 3 times the
* traffic of a and b. If each request/response results in the
* same amount of traffic, then c would be accessed 3 times as
* often as a or b. If, for example, a handled a request that
* resulted in a large i/o bytecount, then b and c would be
* chosen more often, to even things out.
