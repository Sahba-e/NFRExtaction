* Save current r->status and set it to the value of access_status which
* might be different (e.g. r->status could be HTTP_OK if e.g. we override
* the error page on the proxy or if the error was not generated by the
* backend itself but by the proxy e.g. a bad gateway) in order to give
* ap_proxy_post_request a chance to act correctly on the status code.
