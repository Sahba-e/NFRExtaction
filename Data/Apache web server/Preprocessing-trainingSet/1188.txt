/*
* This handles Netscape CONNECT method secure proxy requests.
* A connection is opened to the specified host and data is
* passed through between the WWW site and the browser.
*
* This code is based on the INTERNET-DRAFT document
* "e;Tunneling SSL Through a WWW Proxy"e; currently at
* http://www.mcom.com/newsref/std/tunneling_ssl.html.
*
* If proxyhost and proxyport are set, we send a CONNECT to
* the specified proxy..
*
* FIXME: this doesn't log the number of bytes sent, but
* that may be okay, since the data is supposed to
* be transparent. In fact, this doesn't log at all
* yet. 8^)
* FIXME: doesn't check any headers initally sent from the
* client.
* FIXME: should allow authentication, but hopefully the
* generic proxy authentication is good enough.
* FIXME: no check for r->assbackwards, whatever that is.
