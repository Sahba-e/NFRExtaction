/* sub-requests never use keepalives, and mustn't pass request bodies.
* Because the new logic looks at input_brigade, we will self-terminate
* input_brigade and jump past all of the request body logic...
* Reading anything with ap_get_brigade is likely to consume the
* main request's body or read beyond EOS - which would be unplesant.
*
* An exception: when a kept_body is present, then subrequest CAN use
* pass request bodies, and we DONT skip the body.
