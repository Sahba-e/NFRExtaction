/*
* if the address is given with an explicit netmask, use that
* Due to a deficiency in apr_inet_addr(), it is impossible to parse
* "e;partial"e; addresses (with less than 4 quads) correctly, i.e.
* 192.168.123 is parsed as 192.168.0.123, which is not what I want.
* I therefore have to parse the IP address manually:
* if (proxy_readmask(This->name, &This->addr.s_addr, &This->mask.s_addr) == 0)
* addr and mask were set by proxy_readmask()
* return 1;
