* Cookies are a bit trickier to match: we've got two substrings to worry
* about, and we can't just find them with strstr 'cos of case. Regexp
* matching would be an easy fix, but for better consistency with all the
* other matches we'll refrain and use apr_strmatch to find path=/domain=
* and stick to plain strings for the config values.
