/* X-Forwarded-*: handling
*
* XXX Privacy Note:
* -----------------
*
* These request headers are only really useful when the mod_proxy
* is used in a reverse proxy configuration, so that useful info
* about the client can be passed through the reverse proxy and on
* to the backend server, which may require the information to
* function properly.
*
* In a forward proxy situation, these options are a potential
* privacy violation, as information about clients behind the proxy
* are revealed to arbitrary servers out there on the internet.
*
* The HTTP/1.1 Via: header is designed for passing client
* information through proxies to a server, and should be used in
* a forward proxy configuation instead of X-Forwarded-*. See the
* ProxyVia option for details.
