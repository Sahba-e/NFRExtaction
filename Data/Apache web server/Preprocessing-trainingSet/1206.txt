/**
* Ensure any changes to the session are committed.
*
* This is done in an output filter so that our options for where to
* store the session can include storing the session within a cookie:
* As an HTTP header, the cookie must be set before the output is
* written, but after the handler is run.
*
* NOTE: It is possible for internal redirects to cause more than one
* request to be present, and each request might have a session
* defined. We need to go through each session in turn, and save each
* one.
*
* The same session might appear in more than one request. The first
* attempt to save the session will be called
