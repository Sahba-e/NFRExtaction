/* Unixes (and Netware) have the unlink() semantic, which allows to
* apr_file_remove() a file still in use (opened elsewhere), the inode
* remains until the last fd is closed, whereas any file created with
* the same name/path will use a new inode.
*
* On windows and OS/2 ("e;\SHAREMEM\..."e; tree), apr_file_remove() marks
* the files for deletion until the last HANDLE is closed, meanwhile the
* same file/path can't be opened/recreated.
* Thus on graceful restart (the only restart mode with mpm_winnt), the
* old file may still exist until all the children stop, while we ought
* to create a new one for our new clear SHM. Therefore, we would only
* be able to reuse (attach) the old SHM, preventing some changes to
* the config file, like the number of balancers/members, since the
* size checks (to fit the new config) would fail. Let's avoid this by
* including the generation number in the SHM filename (obviously not
* the persisted name!)
