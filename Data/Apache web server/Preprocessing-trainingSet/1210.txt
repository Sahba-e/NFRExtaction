/* Ensure that we already have, or can fetch, fresh SCTs for each
* certificate. If so, start the daemon to maintain these and let
* startup continue. (Otherwise abort startup.)
*
* Except when we start up as root. We don't want to run external
* certificate-transparency tools as root, and we don't want to have
* to fix up the permissions of everything we created so that the
* SCT maintenance daemon can continue to maintain the SCTs as the
* configured User/Group.
