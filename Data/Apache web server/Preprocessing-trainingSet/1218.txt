/*
* Now we force the SSL renegotiation by sending the Hello Request
* message to the client. Here we have to do a workaround: Actually
* OpenSSL returns immediately after sending the Hello Request (the
* intent AFAIK is because the SSL/TLS protocol says it's not a must
* that the client replies to a Hello Request). But because we insist
* on a reply (anything else is an error for us) we have to go to the
* ACCEPT state manually. Using SSL_set_accept_state() doesn't work
* here because it resets too much of the connection. So we set the
* state explicitly and continue the handshake manually.
