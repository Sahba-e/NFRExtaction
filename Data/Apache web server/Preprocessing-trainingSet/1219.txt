/*
* OpenSSL will call us with either keylen == 512 or keylen == 1024
* (see the definition of SSL_EXPORT_PKEYLENGTH in ssl_locl.h).
* Adjust the DH parameter length according to the size of the
* RSA/DSA private key used for the current connection, and always
* use at least 1024-bit parameters.
* Note: This may cause interoperability issues with implementations
* which limit their DH support to 1024 bit - e.g. Java 7 and earlier.
* In this case, SSLCertificateFile can be used to specify fixed
* 1024-bit DH parameters (with the effect that OpenSSL skips this
* callback).
