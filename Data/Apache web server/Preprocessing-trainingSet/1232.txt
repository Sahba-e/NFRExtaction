/* Server core module... This module provides support for really basic
* server operations, including options and commands which control the
* operation of other modules. Consider this the bureaucracy module.
*
* The core module also defines handlers, etc., to handle just enough
* to allow a server with the core module ONLY to actually serve documents.
*
* This file could almost be mod_core.c, except for the stuff which affects
* the http_conf_globals.
