/* There are two options regarding what the "e;name"e; of a server is. The
* "e;canonical"e; name as defined by ServerName and Port, or the "e;client's
* name"e; as supplied by a possible Host: header or full URI.
*
* The DNS option to UseCanonicalName causes this routine to do a
* reverse lookup on the local IP address of the connection and use
* that for the ServerName. This makes its value more reliable while
* at the same time allowing Demon's magic virtual hosting to work.
* The assumption is that DNS lookups are sufficiently quick...
