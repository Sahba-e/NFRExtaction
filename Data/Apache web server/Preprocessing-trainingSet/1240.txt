/*
* this mode is for filters that might need to 'initialize'
* a connection before reading request data from a client.
* NNTP over SSL for example needs to handshake before the
* server sends the welcome message.
* such filters would have changed the mode before this point
* is reached. however, protocol modules such as NNTP should
* not need to know anything about SSL. given the example, if
* SSL is not in the filter chain, AP_MODE_INIT is a noop.
