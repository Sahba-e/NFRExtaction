/* If mode is EXHAUSTIVE, we want to just read everything until the end
* of the brigade, which in this case means the end of the socket.
* To do this, we attach the brigade that has currently been setaside to
* the brigade that was passed down, and send that brigade back.
*
* NOTE: This is VERY dangerous to use, and should only be done with
* extreme caution. FWLIW, this would be needed by an MPM like Perchild;
* such an MPM can easily request the socket and all data that has been
* read, which means that it can pass it to the correct child process.
