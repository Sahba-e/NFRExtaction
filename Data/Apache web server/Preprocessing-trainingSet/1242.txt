/*
* To send data over high bandwidth-delay connections at full
* speed we must force the TCP window to open wide enough to keep the
* pipe full. The default window size on many systems
* is only 4kB. Cross-country WAN connections of 100ms
* at 1Mb/s are not impossible for well connected sites.
* If we assume 100ms cross-country latency,
* a 4kB buffer limits throughput to 40kB/s.
*
* To avoid this problem I've added the SendBufferSize directive
* to allow the web master to configure send buffer size.
*
* The trade-off of larger buffers is that more kernel memory
* is consumed. YMMV, know your customers and your network!
