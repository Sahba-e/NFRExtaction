/* I seriously doubt that this would work on Unix; I have doubts that
* it entirely solves the problem on Win32. However, since setting
* reuseaddr on the listener -prior- to binding the socket has allowed
* us to attach to the same port as an already running instance of
* Apache, or even another web server, we cannot identify that this
* port was exclusively granted to this instance of Apache.
*
* So set reuseaddr, but do not attempt to do so until we have the
* parent listeners successfully bound.
