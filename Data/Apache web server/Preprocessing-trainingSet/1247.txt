* Now that we have dup'ed s_main->error_log to stderr_log
* close it and set s_main->error_log to stderr_log. This avoids
* this fd being inherited by the next piped logger who would
* keep open the writing end of the pipe that this one uses
* as stdin. This in turn would prevent the piped logger from
* exiting.
