/* The event MPM respects a couple of runtime flags that can aid
* in debugging. Setting the -DNO_DETACH flag will prevent the root process
* from detaching from its controlling terminal. Additionally, setting
* the -DONE_PROCESS flag (which implies -DNO_DETACH) will get you the
* child_main loop running in the process which originally started up.
* This gives you a pretty nice debugging environment. (You'll get a SIGHUP
* early in standalone_main; just continue through. This is the server
* trying to kill off any child processes which it might have lying
* around --- Apache doesn't keep track of their pids, it just sends
* SIGHUP to the process group, ignoring it in the root process.
* Continue through and you'll be fine.).
