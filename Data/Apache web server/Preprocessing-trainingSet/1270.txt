/*
* Signalling Apache on NT.
*
* Under Unix, Apache can be told to shutdown or restart by sending various
* signals (HUP, USR, TERM). On NT we don't have easy access to signals, so
* we use "e;events"e; instead. The parent apache process goes into a loop
* where it waits forever for a set of events. Two of those events are
* called
*
* apPID_shutdown
* apPID_restart
*
* (where PID is the PID of the apache parent process). When one of these
* is signalled, the Apache parent performs the appropriate action. The events
* can become signalled through internal Apache methods (e.g. if the child
* finds a fatal error and needs to kill its parent), via the service
* control manager (the control thread will signal the shutdown event when
* requested to stop the Apache service), from the -k Apache command line,
* or from any external program which finds the Apache PID from the
* httpd.pid file.
*
* The signal_parent() function, below, is used to signal one of these events.
* It can be called by any child or parent process, since it does not
* rely on global variables.
*
* On entry, type gives the event to signal. 0 means shutdown, 1 means
* graceful restart.
