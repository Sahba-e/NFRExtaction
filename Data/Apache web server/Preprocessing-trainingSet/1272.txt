/* Handle the following SCM aspects in this phase:
*
* -k runservice [transition in service context only]
* -k install
* -k config
* -k uninstall
* -k stop
* -k shutdown (same as -k stop). Maintained for backward compatability.
*
* We can't leave this phase until we know our identity
* and modify the command arguments appropriately.
*
* We do not care if the .conf file exists or is parsable when
* attempting to stop or uninstall a service.
