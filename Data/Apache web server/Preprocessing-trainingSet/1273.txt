/* Start the NT Service _NOW_ because the WinNT SCM is
* expecting us to rapidly assume control of our own
* process, the SCM will tell us our service name, and
* may have extra StartService() command arguments to
* add for us.
*
* The SCM will generally invoke the executable with
* the c:\win\system32 default directory. This is very
* lethal if folks use ServerRoot /foopath on windows
* without a drive letter. Change to the default root
* (path to apache root, above /bin) for safety.
