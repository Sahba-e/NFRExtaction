*
* Getting and checking directory configuration. Also checks the
* FollowSymlinks and FollowSymOwner stuff, since this is really the
* only place that can happen (barring a new mid_dir_walk callout).
*
* We can't do it as an access_checker module function which gets
* called with the final per_dir_config, since we could have a directory
* with FollowSymLinks disabled, which contains a symlink to another
* with a .htaccess file which turns FollowSymLinks back on --- and
* access in such a case must be denied. So, whatever it is that
* checks FollowSymLinks needs to know the state of the options as
* they change, all the way down.
