/*
* resolve_symlink must _always_ be called on an APR_LNK file type!
* It will resolve the actual target file type, modification date, etc,
* and provide any processing required for symlink evaluation.
* Path must already be cleaned, no trailing slash, no multi-slashes,
* and don't call this on the root!
*
* Simply, the number of times we deref a symlink are minimal compared
* to the number of times we had an extra lstat() since we 'weren't sure'.
*
* To optimize, we stat() anything when given (opts & OPT_SYM_LINKS), otherwise
* we start off with an lstat(). Every lstat() must be dereferenced in case
* it points at a 'nasty' - we must always rerun check_safe_file (or similar.)
