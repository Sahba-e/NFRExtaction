/*
* Here's a pool-based interface to the POSIX-esque ap_regcomp().
* Note that we return ap_regex_t instead of being passed one.
* The reason is that if you use an already-used ap_regex_t structure,
* the memory that you've already allocated gets forgotten, and
* regfree() doesn't clear it. So we don't allow it.
