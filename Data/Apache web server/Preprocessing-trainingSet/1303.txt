/* Some twisted character [no pun intended] at MS decided that a
* zero width joiner as the lead wide character would be ideal for
* describing Unicode text files. This was further convoluted to
* another MSism that the same character mapped into utf-8, EF BB BF
* would signify utf-8 text files.
*
* Since MS configuration files are all protecting utf-8 encoded
* Unicode path, file and resource names, we already have the correct
* WinNT encoding. But at least eat the stupid three bytes up front.
