/* c2x takes an unsigned, and expects the caller has guaranteed that
* 0 <= what < 256... which usually means that you have to cast to
* unsigned char first, because (unsigned)(char)(x) first goes through
* signed extension to an int before the unsigned cast.
*
* The reason for this assumption is to assist gcc code generation --
* the unsigned char -> unsigned extension is already done earlier in
* both uses of this code, so there's no need to waste time doing it
* again.
