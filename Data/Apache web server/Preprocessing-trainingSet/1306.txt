/* Derived from apr-iconv/ccs/cp037.c for EBCDIC case comparison,
provides unique identity of every char value (strict ISO-646
conformance, arbitrary election of an ISO-8859-1 ordering, and
very arbitrary control code assignments into C1 to achieve
identity and a reversible mapping of code points),
then folding the equivalences of ASCII 41-5A into 61-7A,
presenting comparison results in a somewhat ISO/IEC 10646
(ASCII-like) order, depending on the EBCDIC code page in use.
