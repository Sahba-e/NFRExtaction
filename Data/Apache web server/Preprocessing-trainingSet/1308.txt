/* Copy to YYRES the contents of YYSTR after stripping away unnecessary
quotes and backslashes, so that it's suitable for yyerror. The
heuristic is that double-quoting is unnecessary unless the string
contains an apostrophe, a comma, or backslash (other than
backslash-backslash). YYSTR is taken from yytname. If YYRES is
null, do not copy; instead, return the length of what the result
would have been. */
