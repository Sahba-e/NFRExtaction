/* ap_expr_yylex_init_extra has the same functionality as ap_expr_yylex_init, but follows the
* convention of taking the scanner as the last argument. Note however, that
* this is a *pointer* to a scanner, as it will be allocated by this call (and
* is the reason, too, why this function also must handle its own declaration).
* The user defined value in the first argument will be available to ap_expr_yyalloc in
* the yyextra field.
