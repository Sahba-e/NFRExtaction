/* Lowercase and remove any trailing dot and/or :port from the hostname,
* and check that it is sane.
*
* In most configurations the exact syntax of the hostname isn't
* important so strict sanity checking isn't necessary. However, in
* mass hosting setups (using mod_vhost_alias or mod_rewrite) where
* the hostname is interpolated into the filename, we need to be sure
* that the interpolation doesn't expose parts of the filesystem.
* We don't do strict RFC 952 / RFC 1123 syntax checking in order
* to support iDNS and people who erroneously use underscores.
* Instead we just check for filesystem metacharacters: directory
* separators / and \ and sequences of more than one dot.
