/*
* BUGS:
*
* - uses strcpy/etc.
* - has various other poor buffer attacks related to the lazy parsing of
* response headers from the server
* - doesn't implement much of HTTP/1.x, only accepts certain forms of
* responses
* - (performance problem) heavy use of strstr shows up top in profile
* only an issue for loopback usage
