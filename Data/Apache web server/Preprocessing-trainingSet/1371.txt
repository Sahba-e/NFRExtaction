/* Now that we have removed all of the mod_nw_ssl created socket records,
allow the normal listen socket handling to occur.
NOTE: If for any reason mod_nw_ssl is removed as a built-in module,
the following call must be put back into the pre-config handler of the
MPM. It is only here to ensure that mod_nw_ssl fixes up the listen
socket list before anything else looks at it. */
