/* Common code invoked for both HSE_REQ_SEND_RESPONSE_HEADER and
* the newer HSE_REQ_SEND_RESPONSE_HEADER_EX ServerSupportFunction(s)
* as well as other functions that write responses and presume that
* the support functions above are optional.
*
* Other callers trying to split headers and body bytes should pass
* head/headlen alone (leaving stat/statlen NULL/0), so that they
* get a proper count of bytes consumed. The argument passed to stat
* isn't counted as the head bytes are.
