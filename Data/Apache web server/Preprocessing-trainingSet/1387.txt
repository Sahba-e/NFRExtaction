/**
* Take two sets of headers, sandwich them together, and apply the result to
* r->headers_out.
*
* To complicate this, a header may be duplicated in either table. Should a
* header exist in the top table, all matching headers will be removed from
* the bottom table before the headers are combined. The Warning headers are
* handled specially. Warnings are added rather than being replaced, while
* in the case of revalidation 1xx Warnings are stripped.
*
* The Content-Type and Last-Modified headers are then re-parsed and inserted
* into the request.
