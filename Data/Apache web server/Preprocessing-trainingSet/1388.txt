* Also unset possible Content-Type headers in r->headers_out and
* r->err_headers_out as they may be different to what we have received
* from the cache.
* Actually they are not needed as r->content_type set by
* ap_set_content_type above will be used in the store_headers functions
* of the storage providers as a fallback and the HTTP_HEADER filter
* does overwrite the Content-Type header with r->content_type anyway.
