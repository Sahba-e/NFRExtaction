/*
* Copy the scheme, ensuring that it is lower case. If the parsed uri
* contains no string or if this is not a proxy request get the http
* scheme for this request. As r->parsed_uri.scheme is not set if this
* is a reverse proxy request, it is ensured that the cases
* "e;no proxy request"e; and "e;reverse proxy request"e; are handled in the same
* manner (see above why this is needed).
