* If no value is assigned to max-stale, then the client is willing
* to accept a stale response of any age (RFC2616 14.9.3). We will
* set it to one year in this case as this situation is somewhat
* similar to a "e;never expires"e; Expires header (RFC2616 14.21)
* which is set to a date one year from the time the response is
* sent in this case.
