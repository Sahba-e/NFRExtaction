/*
The expanded content of the macro is to be parsed as a ap_configfile_t.
This is used to have some kind of old fashionned C object oriented inherited
data structure for configs.
The following struct stores the contents.
This structure holds pointers (next, upper) to the current "e;file"e; which was
being processed and is interrupted by the macro expansion. At the end
of processing the macro, the initial data structure will be put back
in place (see function next_one) and the reading will go on from there.
If macros are used within macros, there may be a cascade of such temporary
arrays used to insert the expanded macro contents before resuming the real
file processing.
There is some hopus-pocus to deal with line_number when transiting from
one config to the other.
