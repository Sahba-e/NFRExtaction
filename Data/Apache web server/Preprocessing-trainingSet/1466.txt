/*
Module hooks are request-oriented thus it does not suit configuration
file utils a lot. I haven't found any clean hook to apply something
before then after configuration file processing. Also what about
.htaccess files?
Thus I think that server/util.c or server/config.c
would be a better place for this stuff.
