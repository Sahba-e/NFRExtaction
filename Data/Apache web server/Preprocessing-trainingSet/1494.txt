** If we have a "e;not so bad"e; error, then it might need to go into a
** multistatus response.
**
** For a MOVE, it will always go into the multistatus. It could be
** that everything has been moved *except* for the root. Using a
** multistatus (with no errors for the other resources) will signify
** this condition.
**
** For a COPY, we are traversing in a prefix fashion. If the root fails,
** then we can just bail out now.
