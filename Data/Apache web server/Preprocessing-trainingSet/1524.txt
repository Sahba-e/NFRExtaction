* Check If-Headers and existing locks.

* Note: depth == 0 normally requires no multistatus response. However,
* if we pass DAV_VALIDATE_PARENT, then we could get an error on a URI
* other than the Request-URI, thereby requiring a multistatus.
*
* If the resource does not exist (DAV_RESOURCE_NULL), then we must
* check the resource *and* its parent. If the resource exists or is
* a locknull resource, then we check only the resource.
