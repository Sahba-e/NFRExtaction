/* ### RFC 2518 s. 8.11: If this resource is locked by locktoken,
* _all_ resources locked by locktoken are released. It does not say
* resource has to be the root of an infinte lock. Thus, an UNLOCK
* on any part of an infinte lock will remove the lock on all resources.
*
* For us, if r->filename represents an indirect lock (part of an infinity lock),
* we must actually perform an UNLOCK on the direct lock for this resource.
