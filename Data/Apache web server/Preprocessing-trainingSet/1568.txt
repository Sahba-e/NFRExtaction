** We had a matching state list, but the user agent did not specify one
** of this resource's locktokens. Tell them so.
**
** Note that we need to special-case the message on whether a "e;dummy"e;
** header exists. If it exists, yet we didn't see a needed locktoken,
** then that implies the dummy header (Lock-Token header) did NOT
** specify one of this resource's locktokens. (this implies something
** in the real If: header matched)
**
** We want to note the 400 (Bad Request) in favor of a 423 (Locked).
