/* 2518 requires the entire lock to be removed if resource/locktoken
* point to an indirect lock. We need resource of the _direct_
* lock in order to walk down the tree and remove the locks. So,
* If locktoken != null_locktoken,
* Walk up the resource hierarchy until we see a direct lock.
* Or, we could get the direct lock's db/key, pick out the URL
* and do a subrequest. I think walking up is faster and will work
* all the time.
* Else
* Just start removing all locks at and below resource.
