/*
* This function gets called to merge two per-server configuration
* records. This is typically done to cope with things like virtual hosts and
* the default server configuration The routine has the responsibility of
* creating a new record and merging the contents of the other two into it
* appropriately. If the module doesn't declare a merge routine, the more
* specific existing record is used exclusively.
*
* The routine MUST NOT modify any of its arguments!
*
* The return value is a pointer to the created module-specific structure
* containing the merged values.
