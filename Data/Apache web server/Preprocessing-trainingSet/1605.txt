/*
* Sample content handler. All this does is display the call list that has
* been built up so far.
*
* This routine gets called for every request, unless another handler earlier
* in the callback chain has already handled the request. It is up to us to
* test the request_rec->handler field and see whether we are meant to handle
* this request.
*
* The content handler gets to write directly to the client using calls like
* ap_rputs() and ap_rprintf()
*
* This is a RUN_FIRST hook.
