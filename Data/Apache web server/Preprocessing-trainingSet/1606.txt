/* This routine is used to actually process the connection that was received.
* Only protocol modules should implement this hook, as it gives them an
* opportunity to replace the standard HTTP processing with processing for
* some other protocol. Both echo and POP3 modules are available as
* examples.
*
* This is a RUN_FIRST hook.
