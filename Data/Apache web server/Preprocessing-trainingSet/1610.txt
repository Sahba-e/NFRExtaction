/*
* This routine is called to check for any module-specific restrictions placed
* upon the requested resource. (See the mod_access_compat module for an
* example.)
*
* This is a RUN_ALL hook. The first handler to return a status other than OK
* or DECLINED (for instance, HTTP_FORBIDDEN) aborts the callback chain.
