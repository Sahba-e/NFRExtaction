/* chk_filter_chain() is called once per filter instance; it tries to
* determine if the current filter instance should be disabled because
* its translation is incompatible with the translation of an existing
* instance of the translate filter
*
* Example bad scenario:
*
* configured filter chain for the request:
* INCLUDES XLATEOUT(8859-1->UTS-16)
* configured filter chain for the subrequest:
* XLATEOUT(8859-1->UTS-16)
*
* When the subrequest is processed, the filter chain will be
* XLATEOUT(8859-1->UTS-16) XLATEOUT(8859-1->UTS-16)
* This makes no sense, so the instance of XLATEOUT added for the
* subrequest will be noop-ed.
*
* Example good scenario:
*
* configured filter chain for the request:
* INCLUDES XLATEOUT(8859-1->UTS-16)
* configured filter chain for the subrequest:
* XLATEOUT(IBM-1047->8859-1)
*
* When the subrequest is processed, the filter chain will be
* XLATEOUT(IBM-1047->8859-1) XLATEOUT(8859-1->UTS-16)
* This makes sense, so the instance of XLATEOUT added for the
* subrequest will be left alone and it will translate from
* IBM-1047->8859-1.
