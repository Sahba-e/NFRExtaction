/* xlate_brigade() is used to filter request and response bodies
*
* we'll stop when one of the following occurs:
* . we run out of buckets
* . we run out of space in the output buffer
* . we hit an error or metadata
*
* inputs:
* bb: brigade to process
* buffer: storage to hold the translated characters
* buffer_avail: size of buffer
* (and a few more uninteresting parms)
*
* outputs:
* return value: APR_SUCCESS or some error code
* bb: we've removed any buckets representing the
* translated characters; the eos bucket, if
* present, will be left in the brigade
* buffer: filled in with translated characters
* buffer_avail: updated with the bytes remaining
* hit_eos: did we hit an EOS bucket?
