/**
* Create a data URL as follows:
*
* data:[<mime-type>;][charset=<charset>;]base64,<payload>
*
* Where:
*
* mime-type: The mime type of the original response.
* charset: The optional character set corresponding to the mime type.
* payload: A base64 version of the response body.
*
* The content type of the response is set to text/plain.
*
* The Content-Length header, if present, is updated with the new content
* length based on the increase in size expected from the base64 conversion.
* If the Content-Length header is too large to fit into an int, we remove
* the Content-Length header instead.
