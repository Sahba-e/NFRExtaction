/*
* mod_reqtimeout needs to be called before ap_process_http_request (which
* is run at APR_HOOK_REALLY_LAST) but after all other protocol modules.
* This ensures that it only influences normal http connections and not
* e.g. mod_ftp. Also, if mod_reqtimeout used the pre_connection hook, it
* would be inserted on mod_proxy's backend connections.
