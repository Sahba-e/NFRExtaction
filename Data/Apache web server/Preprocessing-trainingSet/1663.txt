* Handle the Readme file through the postamble, inclusive. Locate

* running the subrequest; text/xxx documents get copied verbatim,
* and any other content type is ignored. This means that a non-text
* document (such as FOOTER.gif) might get multiviewed as the result
* instead of a text document, meaning nothing will be displayed, but
* oh well.
