/* DEFAULT_CGID_LISTENBACKLOG controls the max depth on the unix socket's
* pending connection queue. If a bunch of cgi requests arrive at about
* the same time, connections from httpd threads/processes will back up
* in the queue while the cgid process slowly forks off a child to process
* each connection on the unix socket. If the queue is too short, the
* httpd process will get ECONNREFUSED when trying to connect.
