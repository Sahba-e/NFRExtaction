/* get_client_block is called in a loop to get the request message body.
* This is quite simple if the client includes a content-length
* (the normal case), but gets messy if the body is chunked. Note that
* r->remaining is used to maintain state across calls and that
* r->read_length is the total number of bytes given to the caller
* across all invocations. It is messy because we have to be careful not
* to read past the data provided by the client, since these reads block.
* Returns 0 on End-of-body, -1 on error or premature chunk end.
