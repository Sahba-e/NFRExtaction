/* Check for conditional requests --- note that we only want to do
* this if we are successful so far and we are not processing a
* subrequest or an ErrorDocument.
*
* The order of the checks is important, since ETag checks are supposed
* to be more accurate than checks relative to the modification time.
* However, not all documents are guaranteed to *have* ETags, and some
* might have Last-Modified values w/o ETags, so this gets a little
* complicated.
