/* Get the method number associated with the given string, assumed to
* contain an HTTP method. Returns M_INVALID if not recognized.
*
* This is the first step toward placing method names in a configurable
* list. Hopefully it (and other routines) can eventually be moved to
* something like a mod_http_methods.c, complete with config stuff.
