/* The index is found by its offset from the x00 code of each level.
* Although this is fast, it will need to be replaced if some nutcase
* decides to define a high-numbered code before the lower numbers.
* If that sad event occurs, replace the code below with a linear search
* from status_lines[shortcut[i]] to status_lines[shortcut[i+1]-1];
* or use NULL to fill the gaps.
