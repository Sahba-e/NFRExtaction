/* This is a hack, but I can't find anyway around it. The idea is that
* we don't want to send out 0 Content-Lengths if it is a head request.
* This happens when modules try to outsmart the server, and return
* if they see a HEAD request. Apache 1.3 handlers were supposed to
* just return in that situation, and the core handled the HEAD. In
* 2.0, if a handler returns, then the core sends an EOS bucket down
* the filter stack, and the content-length filter computes a C-L of
* zero and that gets put in the headers, and we end up sending a
* zero C-L to the client. We can't just remove the C-L filter,
* because well behaved 2.0 handlers will send their data down the stack,
* and we will compute a real C-L for the head request. RBB
