/* Our main processing needs to run quite late. Definitely after mod_ssl,
* as we need its connection filters, but also before reqtimeout as its
* method of timeouts is specific to HTTP/1.1 (as of now).
* The core HTTP/1 processing run as REALLY_LAST, so we will have
* a chance to take over before it.
