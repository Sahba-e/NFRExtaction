/* Let's move the buckets from the request processing in here, so
* that the main thread can read them when it has time/capacity.
*
* Move at most "e;maxlen"e; memory bytes. If buckets remain, it is
* the caller's responsibility to take care of this.
*
* We allow passing of file buckets as long as we do not have too
* many open files already buffered. Otherwise we will run out of
* file handles.
