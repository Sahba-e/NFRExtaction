/* Initially, there was ref count increase for this as well, but
* this is not needed, even harmful.
* h2_workers is only a hub for all the h2_worker instances.
* At the end-of-life of this h2_mplx, we always unregister at
* the workers. The thing to manage are all the h2_worker instances
* out there. Those may hold a reference to this h2_mplx and we cannot
* call them to unregister.
*
* Therefore: ref counting for h2_workers in not needed, ref counting
* for h2_worker using this is critical.
