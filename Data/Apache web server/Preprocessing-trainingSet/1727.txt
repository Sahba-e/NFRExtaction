/* Not good. The connection is being torn down and we have
* not sent a goaway. This is considered a protocol error and
* the client has to assume that any streams "e;in flight"e; may have
* been processed and are not safe to retry.
* As clients with idle connection may only learn about a closed
* connection when sending the next request, this has the effect
* that at least this one request will fail.
