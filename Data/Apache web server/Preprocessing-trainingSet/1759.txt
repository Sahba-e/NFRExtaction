/*
* config_log_state holds the status of a single log file. fname might
* be NULL, which means this module does no logging for this
* request. format might be NULL, in which case the default_format
* from the multi_log_state should be used, or if that is NULL as
* well, use the CLF.
* log_writer is NULL before the log file is opened and is
* set to a opaque structure (usually a fd) after it is opened.
