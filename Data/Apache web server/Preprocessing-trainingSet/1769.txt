/* The next five items give the quality values for the dimensions
* of negotiation for this variant. They are obtained from the
* appropriate header lines, except for source_quality, which
* is obtained from the variant itself (the 'qs' parameter value
* from the variant's mime-type). Apart from source_quality,
* these values are set when we find the quality for each variant
* (see best_match()). source_quality is set from the 'qs' parameter
* of the variant description or mime type: see set_mime_fields().
