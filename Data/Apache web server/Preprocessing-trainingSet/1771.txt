/*
* parse quality value. atof(3) is not well-usable here, because it
* depends on the locale (argh).
*
* However, RFC 2616 states:
* 3.9 Quality Values
*
* [...] HTTP/1.1 applications MUST NOT generate more than three digits
* after the decimal point. User configuration of these values SHOULD also
* be limited in this fashion.
*
* qvalue = ( "e;0"e; [ "e;."e; 0*3DIGIT ] )
* | ( "e;1"e; [ "e;."e; 0*3("e;0"e;) ] )
*
* This is quite easy. If the supplied string doesn't match the above
* definition (loosely), we simply return 1 (same as if there's no qvalue)
