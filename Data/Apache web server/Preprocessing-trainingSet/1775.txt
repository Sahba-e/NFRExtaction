/* First, default to no TCN, no Alternates, and the original Apache
* negotiation algorithm with fiddles for broken browser configs.
*
* To save network bandwidth, we do not configure to send an
* Alternates header to the user agent by default. User
* agents that want an Alternates header for agent-driven
* negotiation will have to request it by sending an
* appropriate Negotiate header.
