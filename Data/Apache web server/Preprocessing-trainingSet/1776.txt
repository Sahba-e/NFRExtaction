/* Lynx 2.7 and 2.8 send 'negotiate: trans' even though they
* do not support transparent content negotiation, so for Lynx we
* ignore the negotiate header when its contents are exactly "e;trans"e;.
* If future versions of Lynx ever need to say 'negotiate: trans',
* they can send the equivalent 'negotiate: trans, trans' instead
* to avoid triggering the workaround below.
