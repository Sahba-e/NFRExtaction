/* Sometimes clients will give us no Accept info at all; this routine sets
* up the standard default for that case, and also arranges for us to be
* willing to run a CGI script if we find one. (In fact, we set up to
* dramatically prefer CGI scripts in cases where that's appropriate,
* e.g., POST or when URI includes query args or extra path info).
