/* Matching MIME types ... the star/star and foo/star commenting conventions
* are implemented here. (You know what I mean by star/star, but just
* try mentioning those three characters in a C comment). Using strcmp()
* is legit, because everything has already been smashed to lowercase.
*
* Note also that if we get an exact match on the media type, we update
* level_matched for use in level_cmp below...
*
* We also give a value for mime_stars, which is used later. It should
* be 1 for star/star, 2 for type/star and 3 for type/subtype.
