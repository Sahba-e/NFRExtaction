/* Finding languages. The main entry point is set_language_quality()
* which is called for each variant. It sets two elements in the
* variant record:
* language_quality - the 'q' value of the 'best' matching language
* from Accept-Language: header (HTTP/1.1)
* lang_index - Non-negotiated language priority, using
* position of language on the Accept-Language:
* header, if present, else LanguagePriority
* directive order.
*
* When we do the variant checking for best variant, we use language
* quality first, and if a tie, language_index next (this only applies
* when _not_ using the RVSA/1.0 algorithm). If using the RVSA/1.0
* algorithm, lang_index is never used.
*
* set_language_quality() calls find_lang_index() and find_default_index()
* to set lang_index.
