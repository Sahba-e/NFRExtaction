/* Find language. We match if either the variant
* language tag exactly matches the language range
* from the accept header, or a prefix of the variant
* language tag up to a '-' character matches the
* whole of the language range in the Accept-Language
* header. Note that HTTP/1.x allows any number of
* '-' characters in a tag or range, currently only
* tags with zero or one '-' characters are defined
* for general use (see rfc1766).
*
* We only use language range in the Accept-Language
* header the best match for the variant language tag
* if it is longer than the previous best match.
