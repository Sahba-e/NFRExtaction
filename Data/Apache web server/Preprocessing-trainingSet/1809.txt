/*
* check for the ugly API case of a virtual host section where no
* mod_rewrite directives exists. In this situation we became no chance
* by the API to setup our default per-server config so we have to
* on-the-fly assume we have the default config. But because the default
* config has a disabled rewriting engine we are lucky because can
* just stop operating now.
