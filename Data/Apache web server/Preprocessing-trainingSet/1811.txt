/*
* Hack because of underpowered API: passing the current
* rewritten filename through to other URL-to-filename handlers
* just as it were the requested URL. This is to enable
* post-processing by mod_alias, etc. which always act on
* r->uri! The difference here is: We do not try to
* add the document root
