/*
* This routine gets called at two different points in request processing:
* once before the URI has been translated (during the post-read-request
* phase) and once after (during the header-parse phase). We use different
* config records for the two different calls to reduce overhead (by not
* re-doing the server-wide settings during directory processing), and
* signal which call it is by having the earlier one pass a flag to the
* later one.
