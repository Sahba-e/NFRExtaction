/*
* There are two ways the generation of a unique id can be triggered:
*
* - from the post_read_request hook which calls set_unique_id()
* - from error logging via the generate_log_id hook which calls
* generate_log_id(). This may happen before or after set_unique_id()
* has been called, or not at all.
