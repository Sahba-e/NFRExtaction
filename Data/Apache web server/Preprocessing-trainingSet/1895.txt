/*
* converts a series of buckets into a string
* XXX: BillS says this function performs essentially the same function as
* ap_rgetline() in protocol.c. Deprecate this function and use ap_rgetline()
* instead? I think ftp_string_read() will not work properly on non ASCII
* (EBCDIC) machines either.
