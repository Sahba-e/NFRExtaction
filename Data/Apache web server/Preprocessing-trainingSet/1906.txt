/*
* Save input_brigade in bb brigade. (At least) in the SSL case
* input_brigade contains transient buckets whose data would get
* overwritten during the next call of ap_get_brigade in the loop.
* ap_save_brigade ensures these buckets to be set aside.
* Calling ap_save_brigade with NULL as filter is OK, because
* bb brigade already has been created and does not need to get
* created by ap_save_brigade.
