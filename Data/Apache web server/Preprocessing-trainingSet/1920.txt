/*
* In the case that we are handling a reverse proxy connection and this
* is not a request that is coming over an already kept alive connection
* with the client, do NOT reuse the connection to the backend, because
* we cannot forward a failure to the client in this case as the client
* does NOT expect this in this situation.
* Yes, this creates a performance penalty.
