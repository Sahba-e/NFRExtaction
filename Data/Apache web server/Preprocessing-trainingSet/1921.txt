/* We need to reset backend->close now, since ap_proxy_http_prefetch() set
* it to disable the reuse of the connection *after* this request (no keep-
* alive), not to close any reusable connection before this request. However
* assure what is expected later by using a local flag and do the right thing
* when ap_proxy_connect_backend() below provides the connection to close.
