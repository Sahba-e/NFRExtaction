/*
* Save the original headers in here and restore them when leaving, since
* we will apply proxy purpose only modifications (eg. clearing hop-by-hop
* headers, add Via or X-Forwarded-* or Expect...), whereas the originals
* will be needed later to prepare the correct response and logging.
*
* Note: We need to take r->pool for apr_table_copy as the key / value
* pairs in r->headers_in have been created out of r->pool and
* p might be (and actually is) a longer living pool.
* This would trigger the bad pool ancestry abort in apr_table_copy if
* apr is compiled with APR_POOL_DEBUG.
