/* a server's SCT-related storage on disk:
*
* <rootdir>/<fingerprint>/servercerts.pem
* Concatenation of leaf certificate and any
* configured intermediate certificates
*
* <rootdir>/<fingerprint>/logs
* List of log URLs, one per line; this is
* used to recognize when a log URL configuration
* change makes our current SCT set invalid
*
* <rootdir>/<fingerprint>/AUTO_hostname_port_uri.sct
* SCT for cert with this fingerprint
* from this log (could be any number
* of these)
*
* <rootdir>/<fingerprint>/<anything>.sct
* (file is optional; could be any number
* of these; should not start with "e;AUTO_"e;)
* Note that the administrator should store
* statically maintained SCTs in a different
* directory for the server certificate (specified
* by the CTStaticSCTs directive). A hypothetical
* external mechanism for maintaining SCTs following
* some other model could store them here for use
* by the server.
*
* <rootdir>/<fingerprint>/collated
* one or more SCTs ready to send
* (this is all that the web server
* processes care about)
*
* Additionally, the CTStaticSCTs directive specifies a certificate-
* specific directory of statically-maintained SCTs to be sent.
