/*
* workaround for those OpenSSL versions where SSL_CTX_get0_certificate
* is not yet available: create an SSL struct which we dispose of
* as soon as we no longer need access to the cert. (Strictly speaking,
* SSL_CTX_get0_certificate does not depend on the SSL_CONF stuff,
* but there's no reliable way to check for its existence, so we
* assume that if SSL_CONF is available, it's OpenSSL 1.0.2 or later,
* and SSL_CTX_get0_certificate is implemented.)
