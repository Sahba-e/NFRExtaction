/* The brigade consists of zero-or-more small data buckets which
* can be coalesced (the prefix), followed by the remainder of the
* brigade.
*
* Find the last bucket - if any - of that prefix. count gives
* the number of buckets in the prefix. The "e;prefix"e; must contain
* only data buckets with known length, and must be of a total
* size which fits into the buffer.
*
* N.B.: The process here could be repeated throughout the brigade
* (coalesce any run of consecutive data buckets) but this would
* add significant complexity, particularly to memory
* management. */
