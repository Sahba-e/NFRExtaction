* The SNI extension supplied a hostname. So don't accept requests

* virtual host than the one used for the handshake, causing
* different SSL parameters to be applied, such as SSLProtocol,
* SSLCACertificateFile/Path and SSLCADNRequestFile/Path which
* cannot be renegotiated (SSLCA* due to current limitations in
* OpenSSL, see:
