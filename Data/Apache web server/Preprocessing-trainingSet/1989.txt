/* If we're trying to have the user name set from a client
* certificate then we need to set it here. This should be safe as
* the user name probably isn't important from an auth checking point
* of view as the certificate supplied acts in that capacity.
* However, if FakeAuth is being used then this isn't the case so
* we need to postpone setting the username until later.
