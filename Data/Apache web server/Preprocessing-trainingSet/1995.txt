/*
* Adjust the session id context. ssl_init_ssl_connection()
* always picks the configuration of the first vhost when
* calling SSL_new(), but we want to tie the session to the
* vhost we have just switched to. Again, we have to make sure
* that we're not overwriting a session id context which was
* possibly set in ssl_hook_Access(), before triggering
* a renegotiation.
