/*
* This callback function is executed when the TLS Application-Layer
* Protocol Negotiation Extension (ALPN, RFC 7301) is triggered by the Client
* Hello, giving a list of desired protocol names (in descending preference)
* to the server.
* The callback has to select a protocol name or return an error if none of
* the clients preferences is supported.
* The selected protocol does not have to be on the client list, according
* to RFC 7301, so no checks are performed.
* The client protocol list is serialized as length byte followed by ASCII
* characters (not null-terminated), followed by the next protocol name.
